# MLflow ML Lifecycle Demo

The project builds and compares multiple classification models to predict Type 2 Diabetes
using MLflow for experiment tracking and model management, and Hyperopt for hyperparameter tuning.

This repository demonstrates the usage of **MLflow** to manage the complete ML lifecycle including:
- Experiment Tracking
- Model Logging
- Model Evaluation
- Model Registry
  
## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- MLflow

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suhakh/T2D_Mlflow.git

2. install requirements:
run  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start MLflow Tracking Server:
run mlflow ui

4. Run the Training Script:
run python main.py

##The script will:
- Train baseline models
- Run hyperparameter optimization for each
- Log metrics and parameters to MLflow
- Register and promote the best model to production in the MLflow model registry

##Mlflow tracking:
